# **StreamProvider**
**StreamProvider** in Riverpod is a type of provider that listens to a Stream. It exposes the latest value emitted by the Stream and rebuilds the UI whenever a new value is emitted.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how it works:

1. You define a **StreamProvider** by passing a callback that returns a Stream. This callback receives a ProviderReference which you can use to read other providers.

```dart
final myStreamProvider = StreamProvider<int>((ref) {
  return Stream<int>.periodic(Duration(seconds: 1), (count) => count);
});
```

2. You consume the **StreamProvider** in your UI using a Consumer or ConsumerWidget and calling watch on the provider.

```dart
class MyWidget extends ConsumerWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context, ScopedReader watch) {
    final streamAsyncValue = watch(myStreamProvider);
    return streamAsyncValue.when(
      data: (value) => Text('Value: $value'),
      loading: () => CircularProgressIndicator(),
      error: (error, stack) => Text('Error: $error'),
    );
  }
}
```

3. The StreamProvider listens to the Stream and updates its state whenever a new value is emitted. The UI is rebuilt with the new value.

4. The StreamProvider also handles the lifecycle of the Stream. It automatically subscribes to the Stream when a widget starts watching the provider, and it cancels the subscription when no widgets are watching it anymore.

5. The StreamProvider exposes the Stream's data as an AsyncValue. AsyncValue is a type that can represent data, loading, or error states. You can use the when method to handle these states.
